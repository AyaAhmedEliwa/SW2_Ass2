Our application is a small application on peer to peer architecture.
Running scenario: you will put the port number for you and for any one you want to
connect with him (at the space specified for this) and click on connect once you
click on connect button you are connected. Then you can write message to the
second user (at the space specified for this) and click on send button (you in this
case act as a client) then the message will arrive to the second user who act as
server at the same case and who can replay on the message as a client (that mean
the user can act as a client and as a server).
